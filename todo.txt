show "no tasks, check wikidot"
some emails may require $message = str_replace('\n', "\n", $message); ?

== Things that are just plain wrong ==
doxygen everything
notify.php - translate (it sends emails, so it requires we remember a user's language preference).
tutoring.php - review (update deprecated things), translate
recheck permissions (grep userCan, userIs), check perms in task solution forms

== Security ==
parseUserHTML() - use HTMLPurifier, recheck if evrything applies either this or htmlspecialchars.
Test this XSS-protection with (at least) 'Abćđœ\\n+Plus%25 '. "\n" .'"DQuoted" O\'Brian &&amp; <Company>{{\\\'}}';
automatically validate 'select' to contain one of the options (unless 'other' is set, of course) (e.g. gender in profile can be set to anything).
CSRF protection in $form->submitted();

== Features ==
REQUESTED: profile pictures (and thus a public listUsers and showUser)
update tinymce
replace uber-upload with TinyMCE's html5 uploader?
replace mimetext with jsmath?
language choice.
"payed" checkbox
move columns from table_users to table_edition_users:  motivationletter, gatherplace, comments?
detect when the url is default http://warsztatywww.wikidot.com/www7:tytul-warsztatow
make printable tables (through buildTableHTML)
export those tables to GoogleDocs API?
tinymce <code> (for task solutions - at least handle indentation)
make email X-Sender tag (or lack of it) explicit in email.php
log impersonations
better SELECT, DB_Slice?
make the app more open - publish lists, user profiles, ...
date form fields (e.g. in actionEditOptions).

== Code style ==
notify.php: change $email to either $content or $address, because it's misleading
rename table_workshop_user.participant? table_options->table_settings? table_edition_users.lecturer->islecturer, qualified->isqualified?
transfer lists of constants to enum.php
checkUserCanEditTasks() seems stupid

== Bugs ==
ie6 weird global fixed height? // May have been fixed after google-IE-fix scripts change. If not, try css:zoom:1 (compare szykujpieluchy.pl)
see why TinyMCE includes html-escaped comment tags with MS Word stuff.
