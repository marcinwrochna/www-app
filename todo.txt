== Things that are just plain wrong ==
polish genderize()-printf() conflict.
doxygen everything
installation - at least describe.
notify.php - translate (it sends emails, so it requires we remember a user's language preference).
tutoring.php - review (update deprecated things), translate
recheck permissions (grep userCan, userIs), check perms in task solution forms

== Security ==
gender in profile can be set to anything
parseUserHTML() - use HTMLPurifier, recheck if evrything applies either this or htmlspecialchars.
Test this XSS-protection with (at least) 'Abćđœ\\n+Plus%25 '. "\n" .'"DQuoted" O\'Brian &&amp; <Company>{{\\\'}}';
automatically validate 'select' to contain one of the options (unless 'other' is set, of course).
CSRF protection in $form->submitted();

== Features ==
update tinymce
replace uber-upload with TinyMCE's html5 uploader?
replace mimetext with jsmath?
language choice.
"payed" checkbox
move columns from table_users to table_edition_users:  motivationletter, gatherplace, comments?
in actionEditWorkshop make url in JS when title changes: http://warsztatywww.wikidot.com/www7:tytul-warsztatow
make printable tables through buildTableHTML
export those tables to GoogleDocs API?
tinymce <code> (for task solutions - at least handle indentation)
make email X-Sender tag (or lack of it) explicit in email.php
give the staff the possibility to impersonate a Tester user.
log impersonations
better SELECT, DB_Slice?
make the app more open - publish lists, user profiles, ...

== Code style ==
notify.php: change $email to either $content or $address, because it's misleading
replace in_array... with userIs('role');
rename table_workshop_user.participant? table_options->table_settings? table_edition_users.lecturer->islecturer, qualified->isqualified?
transfer lists of constants to enum.php
change <form> to new Form()
checkUserCanEditTasks() seems stupid

== Bugs ==
ie6 weird global fixed height? // May have been fixed after google-IE-fix scripts change. If not, try css:zoom:1 (compare szykujpieluchy.pl)
see why TinyMCE includes html-escaped comment tags with MS Word stuff.
