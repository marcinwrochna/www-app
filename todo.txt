notify.php - translate (emails- it requires we remember a user's language preference).
// tutoring.php - review, translate
== Showstoppers ==
replace "kadra", "akadra", "jadący" with editions_users.{lectuter,qualified}
publish git (code.google.com/hosting/createProject or maybe gitHub?)
doxygen
redesign workshop info, signup/out buttons in particular. "Signup/Resign button rights are inconsistent."
installation - at least describe.

merge blockStatus:{ok,great} into :accepted
summary.php <- plan.php, user/admin.php
----------------------------------------------------
move hardcoded edition data to table_editions (start, end, meals, actionEditWorkshop's "deadline", ...)
move columns from table_users to table_edition_users:  motivationletter, gatherplace, comments?
check perms in task solution forms

== Security ==
parseUserHTML() - use HTMLPurifier, recheck if evrything applies either this or htmlspecialchars.
Test aforementioned XSS-protection with (at least) 'Abćđœ\\n+Plus%25 '. "\n" .'"DQuoted" O\'Brian &&amp; <Company>';
automatically validate 'select' to contain one of the options (unless 'other' is set, of course).
CSRF protection in $form->submitted();

== Features ==
update tinymce
language choice.
"payed" checkbox
log impersonations
in actionEditWorkshop make url in JS when title changes: http://warsztatywww.wikidot.com/www7:tytul-warsztatow
make printable tables through buildTableHTML
export those tables to GoogleDocs API?
tinymce <code> (for task solutions - at least handle indentation)
make email X-Sender tag (or lack of it) explicit in email.php
give the staff the possibility to impersonate a Tester user.
better SELECT, DB_Slice?
make the app more open - publish lists, user profiles, ...

== Code style ==
notifiy.php: change $email to either $content or $address, because it's misleading
replace in_array... with userIs('role');
rename table_workshop_user.participant? table_options->table_settings? table_edition_users.lecturer->islecturer, qualified->isqualified?
transfer lists of constants to enum.php
change <form> to new Form()
checkUserCanEditTasks() seems stupid

== Bugs ==
ie6 weird global fixed height? // May have been fixed after google-IE-fix scripts change. If not, try css:zoom:1 (compare szykujpieluchy.pl)
see why TinyMCE includes html-escaped comment tags with MS Word stuff.
