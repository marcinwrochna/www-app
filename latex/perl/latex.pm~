# 		require latex;

# $text_to_be_converted will then contain the link to the appropriate image

# 	0 OK
# 	1 Formula longer than 500 characters
# 	2 Includes a blacklisted tag
# 	3 (Not used) Latex rendering failed
# 	4 Cannot create DVI file
# 	5 Picture larger than 500 x 500 followed by x x y dimensions
# 	6 Cannot copy image to pictures directory
